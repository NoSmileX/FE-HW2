  <h1> Biography</h1>
  <p>Emeagwali was born in Akure, Nigeria on 23 August 1954. His early schooling was suspended in 1967 as a result of
    the Nigerian Civil War. At 13 years, he served in the Biafran army. After the war he completed high-school
    equivalence through self-study. He is married to Dale Brown Emeagwali, a noted African-American microbiologist.

  <h2>Court case and the denial of degree</h2>
  <p>Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan from 1987 through 1991. His thesis was not
    accepted by a committee of internal and external examiners and thus he was not awarded the degree. Emeagwali filed a
    court challenge, stating that the decision was a violation of his civil rights and that the university had
    discriminated against him in several ways because of his race. The court challenge was dismissed, as was an appeal
    to the Michigan state Court of Appeals.

  <h4>Emeagwali's simulation was the first program to apply a pseudo-time approach to reservoir modeling.
